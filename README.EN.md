‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: "Pick One from Roadside" and "Lottery" features may draw illegal items that are not available in the game (although "most" have been filtered out).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If there are key conflicts, please manually modify the key settings in the configuration file. Composite keys such as "Ctrl+F1" are supported (Note: cannot conflict with system shortcuts or in-game shortcuts, otherwise the key cannot be recorded properly).

## Future Plans

1. üì¶ Add "Lucky Box" item that randomly draws an item or BUFF when opened
2. ~~Settings persistence~~ ‚úÖ **Completed!**

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved to `{Application.persistentDataPath}/Duckov.LuckyBox/config.json`. A typical path is: `C:/Users/$USER/AppData/LocalLow/TeamSoda/Duckov\Duckov.LuckyBox\config.json`

The configuration file supports:

- **EnableAnimation**: Enable/disable lottery animation (default: `true`)
- **SettingsHotkey**: Hotkey to open settings panel (default: `"F1"`)
  - Supports modifier keys, e.g.: `"Ctrl+F1"`, `"Shift+F2"`, `"Alt+F3"`, `"Ctrl+Shift+F4"`
  - Available modifiers: `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`
- **EnableHighQualitySound**: Enable/disable high-quality item sound effects (default: `true`)
- **HighQualitySoundFilePath**: Custom file path for high-quality item sound effects (default: empty string, uses default sound)
- **RefreshStockPrice**: Cost to refresh merchant inventory (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)
- **StorePickPrice**: Cost to pick from merchant's stock (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)
- **StreetPickPrice**: Cost to pick from all items (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)
- **EnableDestroyButton**: Enable/disable the Destroy button in item menu (default: `true`)
- **EnableLotteryButton**: Enable/disable the Lottery button in item menu (default: `true`)
- **EnableWeightedLottery**: Enable/disable weighted lottery (weight by item quality, default: `false`)

The mod will automatically reload settings when the config file is modified externally.
