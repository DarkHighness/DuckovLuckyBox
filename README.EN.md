## Features

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This mod references item value from the "Item Value Rarity and Search Sounds" mod. If the version of the rarity and value mod you have installed is inconsistent with this mod, it may cause discrepancies between the draw probabilities and in-game experience!

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: "Pick One from Roadside" and "Lottery" features may draw illegal items that are not available in the game (although "most" have been filtered out). Please use it carefully‚ùó Especially for recipes that "look very abnormal"‚ùó This may corrupt your save file. Please backup your save before using‚ùó
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If there are key conflicts, please manually modify the key settings in the configuration file. Composite keys such as "Ctrl+F1" are supported (Note: cannot conflict with system shortcuts or in-game shortcuts, otherwise the key cannot be recorded properly).
