## Features

1. ‚åö A decent-looking lottery animation

2. ‚ôªÔ∏è "Refresh": Refresh the current merchant's inventory

3. üëå "Pick One from Merchant": Randomly draw one item from the current merchant's inventory (reduces stock)

4. üòä "Pick One from Roadside": Randomly draw one item from all possible items in the game (doesn't affect the stock)

5. ‚öôÔ∏è Press F1 to open the settings panel to enable/disable animations and customize the cost of the above three features (default values: 5, 50, 50) (both account balance and cash can be used for payment)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: "Pick One from Roadside" may draw illegal items that are not available in the game (although "most" have been filtered out). Please use it carefully‚ùó Especially for recipes that "look very abnormal"‚ùó This may corrupt your save file. Please backup your save before using‚ùó
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If there are key conflicts, please manually modify the key settings in the configuration file. Composite keys such as "Ctrl+F1" are supported (Note: cannot conflict with system shortcuts or in-game shortcuts, otherwise the key cannot be recorded properly).

## Future Plans

1. üì¶ Add "Lucky Box" item that randomly draws an item or BUFF when opened
2. ~~Settings persistence~~ ‚úÖ **Completed!**

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved to `{Application.persistentDataPath}/Duckov.LuckyBox/config.json`. A typical path is: `C:/Users/$USER/AppData/LocalLow/TeamSoda/Duckov\Duckov.LuckyBox\config.json`

The configuration file supports:
- **EnableAnimation**: Enable/disable lottery animation (default: `true`)
- **SettingsHotkey**: Hotkey to open settings panel (default: `"F1"`)
  - Supports modifier keys, e.g.: `"Ctrl+F1"`, `"Shift+F2"`, `"Alt+F3"`, `"Ctrl+Shift+F4"`
  - Available modifiers: `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`
- **RefreshStockPrice**: Cost to refresh merchant inventory (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)
- **StorePickPrice**: Cost to pick from merchant's stock (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)
- **StreetPickPrice**: Cost to pick from all items (default: `100`, range: 0-5000, step: 100)

The mod will automatically reload settings when the config file is modified externally.

Sample configuration files:
- Basic configuration: [config.example.json](config.example.json)
- With modifier keys: [config.with-modifiers.example.json](config.with-modifiers.example.json)
